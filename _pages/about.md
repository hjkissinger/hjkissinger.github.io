<p>Hi, my name is Hannah J. Kissinger!  I am an interdisciplinary data analyst who loves cleaning and unraveling data mysteries. I have <strong>five years of scientific research experience</strong>, which includes project design, data collection, hypothesis testing, analysis, and presentation. As a lifelong learner, I actively seek opportunities to grow. My two masters' degrees in <em>medical laboratory sciences (MHS)</em> and <em>business administration (MBA)</em> grant me a <strong>unique perspective when solving problems at the intersection of health and business.</strong>
<br><br>
The goal of my projects is to make data-derived insights simple, yet compelling for stakeholders. My data-analyst toolkit includes programming languages <em>R and SQL</em> along with tools such as <em>Spreadsheets, Excel, RStudio, BigQuery, and Tableau.</em> <strong>I believe that knowledge generated from data has the power to protect people and the planet, driving change through informed solutions.</strong>
<br><br>
When I am not working on code, I love to sit in front of my fireplace while I knit and spend time with my six rescue dogs! In the warmer weather, I enjoy going on hikes to identify flora and fauna of New England. <strong>My life philosophy is 'Live Hygge!' </strong><em>(Live Cozy!)</em>
