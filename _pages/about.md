<p>Hi, my name is Hannah J. Kissinger! I am an interdisciplinary data analyst who loves a good data mystery. I currently work at <strong>Yale University as a Program Coordinator in the Office of Development</strong>. My background in business strategy, organizational learning, business intelligence software, analytics, and scientific methods grant me a <strong>unique perspective when revamping business processes for modern-day challenges</strong>. 
<br><br>
Rather than reinventing the wheel, I develop business intelligence tools from common software, such as Microsoft Excel, PowerBI, and Windows PowerShell. I aim to make tools <strong>tailored to specific business problems, replicable, and accessible for all skill levels</strong>.
<br><br>
To create these solutions, I collect information from <em>key stakeholders</em> and then develop the solution with <em>UX design thinking methods</em>. Sometimes this means filling up an entire whiteboard or making colorful sticky-note decision trees! I then develop the business intelligence tool and its standard operating procedure (SOP) <em>jointly</em>, to ensure the replicability. These SOPs detail the process in <strong>textual, diagrammatic, and pictorial formats to improve organizational learning outcomes for all skill levels</strong>.
<br><br>
<strong>My personal wish is to have my projects endure and grow to fit others' needs. So let's collaborate!</strong>
