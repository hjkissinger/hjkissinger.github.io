excerpt: This case study about Cyclistic bike share is from the Coursera Google Analytics Capstone course. I had a lot of fun diving into this messy dataset. There's a very good reason why this project is so popular for data analyst portfolios! The tools I used for this project were R and Tableau. Check out the R Script to follow along or head to my <a href= "https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hannah.kissinger6750/viz/GoogleAnalyticsCapstoneCyclisticBikeSharePTI/CyclisticBikeShareCaseStudy">Tableau</a> visualizations to see the end result!
