This is a case study about Cyclistic bike share from the **Coursera Google Analytics Capstone course**. The goal of this project was to determine factors that differentiate membership and casual bike riders. These factors are then used to develop a marketing campaign that aims to increase the membership conversion rate.

The tools I used for this project were **R and Tableau**. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/hjkissinger/Coursera-GA-Capstone/tree/main/R-scripts">R Script</a> to follow along or head to my <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/GoogleAnalyticsCapstoneCyclisticBikeSharePTI/CyclisticBikeShareCaseStudy?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link">Tableau</a> viz story to see the end result!

# Scenario

The first quarter of 2020 just came to a close. The marketing team at Cyclistic, a Chicago bike share company, wants to develop a targeted marketing campaign that converts casual customers into members. You have access to historical bikeshare data of the past four quarters (2019 Q2/Q3/Q4 and 2020 Q1).

## <u>Stakeholder Goal</u>
> Cyclistic aims to increase its number of annual memberships by targeting casual members through a marketing campaign.

## <u>Business Task</u>
> Using historical data, determine key factors which differentiate casual riders from annual members.
