title: Google Analytics Capstone: Cyclistic Bike Share
excerpt: This is a case study about Cyclistic bike share from the Coursera Google Analytics Capstone course. I had a lot of fun diving into this messy dataset. There's a very good reason why this project is so popular for data analyst portfolios! The tools I used for this project were R and Tableau. Check out the R Script to follow along or head to my Tableau visualizations to see the end result!
