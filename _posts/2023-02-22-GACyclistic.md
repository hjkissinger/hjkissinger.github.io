This is a case study about Cyclistic bike share from the Coursera Google Analytics Capstone course. The goal of this project was to determine factors that differentiate membership and casual bike riders. These factors are then used to develop a marketing campaign that aims to increase the membership conversion rate.

The tools I used for this project were R and Tableau. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/hjkissinger/Coursera-GA-Capstone/tree/main/R-scripts">R Script</a> to follow along or head to my <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hannah.kissinger6750/viz/GoogleAnalyticsCapstoneCyclisticBikeSharePTI/CyclisticBikeShareCaseStudy>Tableau"</a> visualizations to see the end result!
