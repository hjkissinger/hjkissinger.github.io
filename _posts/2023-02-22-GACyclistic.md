excerpt: This is a case study about Cyclistic bike share from the Coursera Google Analytics Capstone course. I had a lot of fun diving into this messy dataset. There's a very good reason why this project is so popular for data analyst portfolios! The tools I used for this project were R and Tableau. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/hjkissinger/Coursera-GA-Capstone/tree/main/R-scripts">R Script</a> to follow along or head to my <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hannah.kissinger6750/viz/GoogleAnalyticsCapstoneCyclisticBikeSharePTI/CyclisticBikeShareCaseStudy>Tableau"</a> visualizations to see the end result!
